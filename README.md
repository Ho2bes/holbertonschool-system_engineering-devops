# Web Infrastructure Design Project

This repository contains diagrams and explanations for different **web infrastructure designs**. The project focuses on understanding how to design and architect web infrastructure for scalability, performance, and security, covering various layers such as servers, databases, and load balancers.

## üìù Project Overview

**Web infrastructure design** involves the planning and structuring of the components needed to build and run web applications. This project explains how to design a robust, scalable, and secure web infrastructure. Topics covered include load balancing, database replication, firewalls, and the use of caching for performance optimization.

### Key Concepts:
- **Servers**: Understanding the role of web servers and application servers in web infrastructure.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and scalability.
- **Databases**: Exploring database replication, sharding, and backups to handle data efficiently.
- **Caching**: Implementing caching strategies using CDNs, in-memory caches (like Redis), and database query caches.
- **Firewalls and Security**: Protecting the infrastructure from external threats with firewalls, VPNs, and SSL.

### Skills Gained:
- Designing web infrastructure for high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.
- Understanding the role of load balancers in distributing traffic.
- Implementing caching strategies to improve performance.
- Ensuring security by adding firewalls, SSL, and other security measures.
